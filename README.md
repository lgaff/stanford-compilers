==================

Assignment source code for cs143 Compilers course via Coursera.

These are my submissions for the programming assignments for the compilers course available on Coursera.org.

The assignments each implement a component of a compiler for the Classroom Object Oriented Language. Note that I've only
put up the parts that were my own work: given that the course is fast-paced and designed to fit around the lives
of those with full time jobs, a significant amount of the compiler is given pro-bono, including all support libraries and
data structures.
